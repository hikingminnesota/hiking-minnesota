        <div className="about-section">
          <p>Hi there! My name is Matthew. I created this website. I'm a Minnesotan who loves hiking, and I wanted to create a free resource for hiking fans.</p>
          <p>I had the idea for this site a couple of years ago.   I had a random idea one day to create something with "hiking + badges", and I actually wrote a note to myself to remember it.</p>
          <p>Years ago, back when Foursquare was new and exciting, I was spending hours and hours every week trying to collect Foursquare badges.</p>   
          <p>At the time, I felt the same way about Foursquare badges that some people feel about Pokemon;  I wanted to collect everything.</p>
          <p>I have so much nostalgia for that era in my life.   It brings back a lot of memories thinking about 2010, 2011.</p>
          <p>This website is a hybrid of my nostalgia for 2010-era Foursquare and my love for hiking.</p>

        {/* Explanation Of Badge Geolocation */}
        <h2 className="about-heading">How Does Awarding Badges Work?</h2>
        <div className="about-section">
          <p>
            When you try to earn a badge, the website runs this line:   
          </p>
          <p>
          <img src={codepiece} alt="Piece of code" className="about-image" style={{ width: "80%", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto", display: "block" }}/>
          </p>
          <p>
            That snippet of code queries the browser on your mobile device or tablet for your geolocation, which we compare to the latitude/longitude coordinates for the hike trailhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're within a mile and half of the trailhead, you get the badge.
          </p>
          <p>
            After you click on the button to try for a badge, we don't continue to ask the browser for your location afterwards.  The location check is a one-time thing which only runs at the moment the button is pushed.
          </p>
        </div>

          {/* Explanation Of Badge Design */}
        <h2 className="about-heading">Will You Add More Hikes And More Badges?</h2>
        <div className="about-section">
          <p>
            The current goal is yes, more hikes and more badges will be added to this site.</p> 
          <p>
            There's no current timeframe for when, but additional content is indeed the goal.</p>

            I created another website, named {" "}
            <a href="https://freegptprompts.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              FreeGPTPrompts.org
            </a>
            , a utility tool website for people who are beginning the process of learning about AI and want 
            lots of free prompts to try.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started learning about AI, I wanted to try a huge variety of different prompts, to see what
            the AI was capable of.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn’t able to find any website with a variety of free prompts. Every site had prompts
            locked behind a paywall, or being sold as "prompt packs" (which is stupid).
          </p>
          <p>Free GPT Prompts was my attempt to create the utility tool that I needed.</p>
